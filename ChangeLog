2001-08-15:	Version 1.0.1:

		New features:
                None.

                Changes:
                This is a minimal maintenance release designed to correct a
                few problems that have cropped up since Oliver left off work
                on moxfm, and produce a viable current distribution of the
                source.

                Bug Fixes:
                - regexp/regexp.c: Commented out argument-less declaration for
                strchr(), which causes compile failures with recent compilers.
                I know of no systems on which this declaration is needed any
                longer.
                - regexp/regsub.c: Commented out argument-less declaration for
                strncpy().
                - src/Common.h: Added logic to force define for SYSV on recent
                Linux systems, so that getwd will be properly redefined as
                getcwd. getwd is a dangerous function that generally should not
                be used, and recent versions of gcc issue a warning to this
                effect.
                - src/FmFw.c, src/FmIcons.c: Added a workaround for a failure
                of double-clicks to work under certain window managers/window
                manager modes, due to ill-synchronized passive grabs by the
                window manager on a parent window. This "fix" is based on a
                similar one made by Till Straumann for xfm.

OLD ChangeLog:
**************

Date (yy-mm-dd):

95-08-17:	Moxfm v. 0.9 is available for public
		use for the first time via WWW. It is

		windows changed again. Mount point
		detection improved.

95-08-26:	Version 0.94: When copying, moving,
		linking or deleting fails for a number
		of files, the screen is no longer flooded
		with error message dialogs, but the
		user has the chance to cancel the
		operation. Changes in the code for
		recursive copying. Bugfixes.

		status display in connection with file

		will support copying files to/from a
		remote machine. Bugfix concerning

		in FmFwActions.c and FmOps.c.

		- You cannot drop a file onto itself
		  any longer.
		
		Bugfixes:
		- When a filename is specified for an
		  application button, the filename is
		  passed as first argument also for
		  drop actions. This implies e.g. that
		  the drop action for the trashcan should
		  be
		  "shift;mv -f -b -V numbered $* ~/.trash"
		  now (as for xfm).
		- The icon names are set correctly now.

95-09-09:	Bugfix in usermount utility: userfstab
		file is checked for all mount options,
		not only "read-only" now.

95-09-18:	Version 0.98:

		New features:
		- There is a popup menu of the directory
		  name text field now (thanks to Steve
		  Blake for idea.)
		- The "File" pulldown menu has a "Perform
		  action" item now.
		- The mount table window has a "Close"
		  button.
		- Links are always made to *relative*
		  paths.
		- New resources saveOnExit and newWinOnDirPopup.
		
		Bugfixes:
		- Moxfm should hopefully compile on OSF/1
		  and SVR4 systems now (thanks to Albert
		  Graef and Volker Mertens).
		- Moxfm compiles with Motif 2.0 now.
		- Moxfm doesn't crash any longer when it
		  cannot allocate enough colors for the
		  pixmaps (thanks to Detlef Schmier).
		- The icon names should really be correct
		  now.
		  
		Changes:
		- When the autoSave feature of the
		  application windows is enabled, the
		  configuration is saved directly after
		  every change and not first when moxfm
		  exits.
		- The *relative* paths of dropped files
		  are passed to application buttons with
		  specified directories now.
		- There is a "Perform action" item in the
		  pulldown menu of directory icons, too.
		- New suppressWarnings resource instead of
		  suppressXtWarnings resource.
		- The names of the application group
		  configuration files don't start with "xfm-"
		  any longer.

96-05-16:	Version 1.0:

		New features:
		- Files and applications can be placed as icons
		on the root window.
		- Added automatic application window updates along
		with a checkApplicationFiles resource, and an applBoxIcon
		resource for specifying the standard application group
		icon. Furthermore, newly created application groups now
		point back to the group they were created in.
		(ag@muwiinfa.geschichte.uni-mainz.de)
		- Added a facility for monitoring files during
		automatic updates, along with the new xfmmon
		configuration file (AG).
		- You can drop user defined objects (listed in
		targets configuration file) on application windows.
		- You can switch off magic headers for certain
		devices and file windows.
		- You can move files across devices now.
		- The file type configuration file can be reread
		during runtime.
		- An "about" message box has been added.
		- Added an *applBoxIcon resource for specifying the
		standard application group icon (AG).
		- An implementation of the memmove() function is
		provided for systems without one.
		(uknt@brwlserv.cnet.att.com)
		
		- New resources and menu items in connection
		with the new features.
		- The *passedNamePolicy resource has been
  		added.

		Changes:
		- The formats of the startup file and of the device
		configuration file have changed (see INSTALL).
		- Interactive performance has been improved, esp.
		on slow devices. The performance penalty of
		setting the Moxfm.checkFiles option to true is
		much smaller now.
		- The scrolling behavior of the file windows has
		been improved.
		- Newly created application groups now point back to
		the group they were created in (AG).
		- Moxfm works better with Motif 2.0.

		Bugfixes:
		Numerous. The Linux usermount utilities have
		been improved. The FmMount.c module should
		really compile on most platforms now, at least if
		you compile with -DNO_GETMNTENT.
