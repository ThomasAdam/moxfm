MOXFM INSTALLATION GUIDE
________________________

I have compiled and installed moxfm on Linux
1.2.x, HP-UX 9.03 and IRIX 5.3 with both Motif 1.2.
and Motif 2.0. I have received reports that moxfm
also runs on Solaris 2.x, OSF/1 3.x, AIX, SunOS 4.x
and NetBSD 1.1, though it must probably be
compiled with the -DNO_GETMNTENT option on
most of these platforms (see below). I hope moxfm
will compile and run on many more systems,
too, please report any successes on other platforms
as well as problems to me (mai@x4u2.desy.de).
Of cource, I am very interested in patches, too.

The FORMATS of the startup file and of the device
configuration file HAVE CHANGED in version 1.0.
Please remove your startup file (typically ~/.moxfm/startup)
and edit your device configuration file (~/.moxfm/moxfmdev)
to fit the format described in the manual page.

The installation of moxfm should be fairly simple.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of
moxfm you might want to backup your application
configuration files (in /usr/X11/lib/moxfm/dot.moxfm/
or so) first.

Edit the Imake.options file to adapt it to your system.
You might want to change the following defaults:

  -	the directories, where moxfm's configuration
  	files and the bitmaps are going to be installed

  -	Normally, moxfm will use "magic headers" to
  	determine the file types. If you want moxfm
  	to determine the file types by suffixes of
  	the file names only, don't #define MAGIC_HEADERS.
  
  -	You might need to tell the compiler where to
  	look for Motif and libXpm headers and
  	libraries.
  	
  -	If you have a Linux system and want to access
  	devices as floppies or CD-ROM thru moxfm, you
  	probably want to install the usermount utility
  	by #defining MAKE_USMOUNT. You will have to
  	customize the userfstab file. For this, read
  	the usermount(1) man page. If you are already
	using the usermount utility, backup your userfstab
	file.
  
  -	If you want to compile moxfm with the GNU C
  	compiler gcc and gcc is not the default compiler
  	of your system, #define USE_GCC. You should
  	try this option if your default compiler is
  	unable to compile moxfm (e.g. some HP
  	compilers).
  	
Having done this, type
	./MakeMakefiles
to generate the makefiles and to check the dependencies.

Compile moxfm by simply saying
	make

If you have problems compiling FmMount.c, especially
on OSF/1 and AIX, try to uncomment the line
MOUNT_DEF = -DNO_GETMNTENT
in Imake.options. Now FmMount.c should compile, but
- moxfm will assume that all configured devices are
  not mounted on startup of moxfm,
- the "Update display" button of the mount table window
  will be disabled, and
- you shouldn't (un)mount configured devices by
  other means than with moxfm, in order not to confuse
  the program.

If you get other error messages, try to compile with gcc,
to #undef MAGIC_HEADERS if necessary, or to #define
USE_STATVFS (if the system supports the statvfs system
call in stead of statfs). If you need to make any
changes in the source code or in the Imakefiles to
compile moxfm, please report to mai@x4u2.desy.de.

You install moxfm by becoming root and typing
	make install
	make install.man

CAUTION: If you have a previous
version of moxfm installed on your system, you might
want to backup your customized configuration
files first.

If you want to install the moxfm binaries, man pages
and application defaults file in different
directories than the default ones, simply copy
src/moxfm, src/moxfm.man, Moxfm.ad and eventually
the files in usermount/ by hand. You have to
'make install' anyway (but not necessarily as root)
in order to install the pixmaps and configuration
files, whose target directories you can specify in
Imake.options, and in order to generate an application
defaults file.
(Note: If you know about a way to specify the
target directories in the Imake.options file in
a portable way, please tell me :-)

If everything goes smoothly, you should have a
moxfm binary installed in your X bin directory,
along with some other stuff (note the directories
may not be identical on your system, it is up to
imake to install these things in the correct place):

/usr/X11/lib/X11/moxfm/
	bitmaps				Some bitmaps
	pixmaps				Some pixmaps
	dot.moxfm			Default config files
/usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults/Moxfm	application defaults
					for moxfm (important!)
/usr/X11/man/man1/moxfm.1x		the manual page

Finally, you should customize the system-wide
application defaults file Moxfm (esp. you might need
to adjust the *pixmapPath and *bitmapPath resources).
Copy it to your home directory then and adapt it to
your personal preferences then.

You should be able to start moxfm now -- if not,
read the documentation (README, manpage) once
more and contact me (mai@sugra.desy.de) if this
doesn't help.


Have fun!
