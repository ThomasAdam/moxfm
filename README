NOTE: Since Oliver Mai's homepage seems to be gone, I decided to
make this package available on the xfm website. Bob Woodside donated
the moxfm-1.0 sources and contributed some patches, and I gave moxfm
a little facelift using the 3dicons from the xfm and xplore packages.
Please note that this software is not maintained any longer, but I
hope you enjoy it anyway. Sep 03 2001 Albert Graef

MOXFM - the free Motif file manager (v. 1.0)
_________________________________________________


Moxfm was written using the source code of the
excellent Athena widgets based xfm file manager
and is intended to combine the advanced features
of xfm with the (IMHO) even more user-friendly
look and feel of the OSF/Motif (TM) GUI.

DESCRIPTION

Moxfm is a full-fledged file and application manager for UN*X
platforms running the X Window system. It is quite similar to
the xfm file manager, whose source code moxfm is based upon,
and uses configuration files with the same format as xfm
(except the device configuration file, see the manpage moxfm(1)),
but there are quite some differences, too. If you are a xfm
user, you might want to read the README.moxfm-xfm file for the
most important differences between moxfm and xfm.

Moxfm - as xfm - allows you to browse your directory tree and to
copy, move, link and delete files in an intuitive way by simple
drag-and-drop actions. It provides context-sensitive popup menus.
Directory displays are updated automatically in regular intervals
when the contents of the directory changes.

The integrated application manager provides a kind of shelf on
which you can place your favorite applications as well as the
files and directories you are currently working with, and even
other (user-defined) types of dragged objects. It also
allows you to access different groups of applications and files.
User-definable file types let you specify a command to be
executed when double-clicking on a file or dropping other files
onto it. You can place files and applications as icons on the root
window and use them both for starting applications, opening
directory windows, and as drop sites. Application windows as well
as the desktop icons can also be updated automatically whenever the
corresponding application files change. Furthermore, moxfm provides
a monitoring facility which allows to ``have an eye'' on important
files and directories and respond with user-defined actions to
certain types of events when the status of one of these files
changes.

Last not least, moxfm can automatically mount and unmount
special devices like floppies as you open and close the
corresponding directories (mount points) or copy files to them.


INSTALLATION

Read the INSTALL file.
If you upgrade from an older version of moxfm, please read the
INSTALL file, too, as SOME FILE FORMATS HAVE CHANGED.

To compile, moxfm requires both OSF/Motif 1.2 or 2.0 and
Arnaud Le Hors' XPM library.
Binary versions of moxfm with Motif and the XPM library linked
statically are available for Linux-i386 (both ELF and a.out formats)
and HP-UX 9.x (see WHERE TO GET MOXFM).

If you are using the FVWM window manager, you should add the line
Style "desktop icon"	WindowListSkip
to your .fvwmrc (or to the system-wide system.fvwmrc).
You should not have the "NoPPosition" flag in your .fvwmrc in
order for desktop icon alignment to work.

If you are using a different window manager than fvwm or mwm,
the appearance of the desktop icons might not be as intended.
Twm doesn't remove the title bar, and ol[v]wm has some
problems, too. If you find a patch to solve these incompatibilities,
please tell me.

ICONS

Moxfm comes with a basic collection of pixmap icons from
various sources on the net, including icons from Linux
slackware, the X desktop manager (xdtm), the 0.91 beta
release of the G.R.E.A.T. environment, the AIcons collection
and the fvwm window manager. Most icons are taken from the
xfm-1.3.2 distribution. The icons with a beveled-edge
background where taken from an icon collection by Joerg
Mertin. If you want to use more of them, download
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/icons/3d_pixmaps_1.0.tar.gz .
You might then want to change the Moxfm.appIconWidth and
Moxfm.appIconHeight resources to 56 and 46, respectively,
and change the background color, too.
There are no two-color bitmaps distributed with moxfm, but
they can be used as well, if you are running a version moxfm
linked with X11R6 and Motif 2.0.

A comprehensive set of pixmap fileicons has been collected
and edited for use with xfm by Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es).
These pixmaps are included in the moxfm distribution and are
installed during the 'make install' step.

Tons of other icons can be found on the net. For instance,
take a look at the AIcons collection or pixmaps.tar.gz, both
in the R5contrib directory on ftp.x.org. You might also consider
to install the xbmbrowser program written by Ashley Roll and
Anthony Thyssen (also on ftp.x.org), if you haven't done
this already.


STANDARD SETUP

The standard setup (files in the lib directory) consists of
the magic and xfmrc files for common filetypes, a sample moxfmdev
file (specifying how special devices like floppy disks are mounted
and unmounted), the targets configuration file (see the manpage
about it), and a set of useful application groups. It is
intended as a starting point for developing a personal setup which
fits your taste and requirements.

Quite some preconfigured application buttons require the xless browser,
which is available from ftp://ftp.x.org.
(Hint: xless looks much nicer, when you link it with the 3D version
of the Athena widgets, and use a non-white background color, e.g.
grey. Set the *shapeStyle resource to "rectangle"). A nicer
browser is pipescript from the Andrew toolkit (AUIS), but it takes
much more time to come up.


WHERE TO GET MOXFM

You can get the moxfm sources as well as binary distributions for
Linux (i386 architectures), HP-UX 9.x and IRIX 5.x from my WWW page
	http://ips105.desy.de:8765/~mai/moxfm
Both the sources and Linux binaries are also available via ftp from
	ftp://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/unix/systems/linux/local/X11/
A source-only distribution can be obtained from
	ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/moxfm-src.tgz

The xfm-1.3.2 sources, which moxfm is based on, are available at
ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/xfm-1.3.2.tar.gz


BUG REPORTS

Please send all bug reports and patches to mai@sugra.desy.de.
Always include the operation system of the machine you are
running moxfm on, as well as the Motif version.

Have fun!
