Known bugs in moxfm-1.0:

- Versions of moxfm linked with X11R5 and/or
  Motif 1.x don't work with two color bitmaps. You
  have to use pixmaps or a version of moxfm linked
  with X11R6 and Motif 2.0.

- Very probably due to a bug in Motif 2.0, file
  windows can sometimes "forget" there drop site
  structure. Just clone the file window and close
  the old one. This behavior has not yet been
  observed with Motif 1.x.
  
- When moxfm is copying files in the background to or
  from slow devices such as floppies, the interactive
  performance becomes quite bad. This will be fixed
  by a multithreaded version some time.

- When you drag the contents of an ASCII file into e.g.
  a Motif editor, the drag operation will fail for
  files larger than 250,000 Bytes. I don't know if it
  works for all smaller files on all platforms.
  
- When you are running moxfm over a heavily loaded
  network, interactive performance (especially for
  drag'n'drop) can be quite bad.
  
If you find more bugs, please contact me (mai@sugra.desy.de).
Please include information about the system you are running
moxfm on, and if you were having any problems during
installation. Thanks for your cooperation!
